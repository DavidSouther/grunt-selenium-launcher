# grunt-selenium-launcher

A Grunt task to launch a selenium server.

## Usage

Load the task:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-selenium-launcher');
```

Call the task:

```javascript
grunt.registerTask 'e2e-tests', [ 'selenium-launch', 'cucumberjs' ]
```

Use the settings exported to the environment to connect to the correct instance:

```javascript
var driver = new require("selenium-webdriver").Builder()
	.usingServer(process.env.SELENIUM_HUB)
	.withCapabilities(webdriver.Capabilities.firefox())
	.build()
```

## API

### Grunt Task

**selenium-launch**
Attempt to launch a selenium instance, binding to `process.env.SELENIUM_LAUNCHER_PORT`. If that port is unavailable, the launcher will iterate ports until it finds one available, and then resets `process.env.SELENIUM_LAUNCHER_PORT` to that. The task completes when the server is running and bound. The server is automatically killed when the grunt process exits - no need to take extreme steps to ensure the process isn't left a zombie.

### Environment Variables

**SELENIUM_LAUNCHER_PORT**
If exported in the shell *before* running grunt, defines the preferred port to run Selenium on. After the task has run, while inside the node environment it has the value of the port selenium eventually bound on.

```bash
SELENIUM_LAUNCHER_PORT=4567 grunt selenium-launch webdriverTask
```

**SELENIUM_HUB**
After the task has run, has the string URI for webdriver hub connection. Use this string when connecting clients to selenium. See the above examples.
